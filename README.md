This repository contains the second exercise form week 3 of the mission nodeJs by LaunchX.

Main purpose of this project was to put in practice the Test Driven Development technique for Software Design by Martin Fowler which consists in first create tests for the next portion of code we have to write, then write the current code and test it with out previously created test until it passes all the tests.

1. Creation of the project as we learnt in the past exercise.
2. Creation of a spiderman file for the class and a spiderman.test file for the tests
3. Creation of test and failed it
4. Creation of class and failed again test because it's empty
5. Write a constructor for the class withe name attribute, and failed test for the third time
6. Write whole required attributes and passed test
7. Creation of a new test with new instance of the class spiderman to test a method getInfo and failed test
8. Write the code with method required and passed test
